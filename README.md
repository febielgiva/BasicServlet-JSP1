# BasicServlet-JSP1

In this I going to implement a simple Todo List web application using Servlet and JSP.

Adding servlet(s) and JSP to the web project to implement a simple Todo List .TO DO LIST has the details of item, date the task is done, and completing the task option.

The todo list shows a list of items, and for each item, the date when the item was added to the list.
A user can use the form at the bottom of the list to add new items.

Clicking on the X of an item marks the item as completed. A completed item is crossed out and its X removed, but the item is not removed from the list also moves the item to the end of the list when it's marked as completed.
